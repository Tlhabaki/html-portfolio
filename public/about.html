<p>I am a South African community leader, farmer, and entrepreneur dedicated to public safety and agricultural development. As the Public Relations Officer for the Haakdoornboom Sector 3 Community Policing Forum (CPF), I work to strengthen collaboration between the community and law enforcement to improve security.</p>
<p>I run Emerald Dynasty Farm, where I cultivate okra and coriander for market supply. Beyond farming, I have developed custom digital tools using AppSheet to streamline farm management and invoicing. Always looking to grow and innovate, I am currently learning full-stack web development to expand my technological skills and create new opportunities.</p>
